Title: Clue Note — a mobile-friendly notebook that computes probabilities for Clue

Body:
Hey folks — I built Clue Note, a small mobile-first web app that helps a single player record suggestions/reveals and computes per-card probabilities to help solve Clue. No sign-in or tracking required — it runs in your browser.

Live demo: https://clue-note.vercel.app/
Source: https://github.com/Subroto-debnath/Clue-Notes

Quick features:
- Setup players and initial hands
- Record suggestions and who showed or passed
- Solver computes P(player has card) and P(card is in the envelope)
- Undo, mobile-friendly UI

Happy to answer questions — would love feedback from other Clue fans!

Hi everyone — I made a small browser-based tool called Clue Note to help keep track of suggestions and shows during a physical game of Clue. It computes probabilities for who might hold each card and highlights cards that are nearly certain. No accounts required; works on mobile.

Demo: https://clue-note.vercel.app/
